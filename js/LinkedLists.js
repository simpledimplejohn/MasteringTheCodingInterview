/*
head
nodes: value and pointer
tail -points to null 
JAVA has linked lists
Good at inserting changes and deleting in the middle
traversal instead of itteration, because you don't know when it will end

prepend O(1) adding to the begining
append O(1) adding to the end
lookup O(n) because you have to loop through the list to find anything
insert O(n)
delete O(n)
pointer --> reference to another place in the memory
Garbage collection
